title: "About Me"
permalink: /about

Hi,I’m a graduate student developer from the Amazon Cloud Institute (ACI) with a strong focus on cloud engineering, serverless development, and modern AWS practices. Before stepping into the cloud world, I spent three years as a Linux Administrator, managing systems, optimizing performance, and supporting secure, reliable infrastructure. That experience shaped my approach to engineering: detail‑oriented, automation‑driven, and grounded in real operational understanding. I hold five industry certifications, including two from AWS, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and staying aligned with industry standards. Through ACI’s hands‑on curriculum, I’ve built practical experience with AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, and SAM, along with development skills in Python and infrastructure‑as‑code. Today, I’m focused on transitioning into a full cloud engineering career, where I can combine my Linux background with cloud‑native design, automation, and scalable architecture. I enjoy solving real problems, building efficient workflows, and contributing to projects that leverage AWS to deliver secure, modern, and resilient solutions. Outside of work, I’m always exploring new tools, refining my skills, and building projects that push me further into the cloud ecosystem.
